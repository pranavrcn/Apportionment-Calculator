Congressional Apportionment Project

## Overview
This project implements Alexander Hamilton's Apportionment algorithm to distribute congressional seats among U.S. states based on population data. The algorithm ensures fair representation by allocating seats proportionally according to state populations.

## Key Features
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Applied Hamilton's method to compute seat allocation.
- **CSV Data Handling**: Processed and validated state population data from CSV files.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Developed a CLI for running the apportionment calculation with customizable parameters.

## Skills Used
- **Java**: Core programming language for algorithm implementation and data handling.
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control for collaborative development.
- **Gradle**: Build automation and dependency management.
- **IntelliJ**: Integrated Development Environment for coding and debugging.
